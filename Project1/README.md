# Machine learning

## Project 1 made by 3 students

**Description:**

1. Prepare the data set

1. Buid and evaluate logistic regression
->best e parameter (training/valildation set)
->evaluate->test set

1. Build and evaluate k-NN
->to find the best K (training/valildation set)
->evaluate with test set

1. Build and evaluate Naive Bayes
->bandwidth of gk
->evaluate with test sci

1. Compare the 3 classifiers with statistical significance test

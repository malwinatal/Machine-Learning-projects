Machine learning

Project 1 made by 3 students

Description:

1.Prepare the data set

2.Buid and evaluate logistic regression
->best e parameter (training/valildation set)
->evaluate->test set

3.Build and evaluate k-NN
->to find the best K (training/valildation set)
->evaluate with test set

4.Build and evaluate Naive Bayes
->bandwidth of gk
->evaluate with test sci

5.Compare the 3 classifiers with statistical significance test
